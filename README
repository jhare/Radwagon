Finally getting around to definiing this idea...

==== Radwagon ====

Advanced torrent and RSS manager made solely for my own prurient desires and amusement.

Many torrent clients offer a set of these functionalities under the umbrella of their program
and you're pretty much at their mercy. I hope to re-use or support a number of torrent clients while
leaving functionality I believe belongs *outside* of the client to a more *nix-like set of utilities
and rules.

Initial goals are:
* Advanced RSS management
  * Allow more than just basic matching operations on downloading a file
  * Regular expression-based
* Per-tracker rule sets
  * For ratios
  * Seeding/Leeching
  * File destinations
* File management
  * Rule-based filing of completed torrents
  * Transfer of files across protocols to other devices
* Taggable trackers
* Media server management
